## About Me

I'm currently working in BMD software, a company that builds innovative software solutions for healthcare, combining simplicity with high-end technologies.

I did PhD in biomedical informatics (former in November 2015), mainly focused in large scale applications and data integration for medical informatics. I've was also software creator and developer. I worked at Bioinformatics Group at the Institute of Electronics and Telematics Engineering of Aveiro (IEETA) in the University of Aveiro (UA).

I developed and implemented several information retrieval systems with Apache Lucene, Solr, and ElasticSearch. The expertise has been developed with focus to extract and integrate heterogeneous data sources, which includes index, search and retrieval in several types of documents and databases.

My main programming and skills are: software architecture design, developing web applications in Java and Python (PlayFramework, Jetty, Django) with HTML5, Javascript, React.JS, Angular 1, 4 and Node.JS. I‚Äôm also experience with deployment applications in productions, Windows Servers, UNIX (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Linux distros), Docker, nginx, application servers (Tomcat, uwsgi, etc) and general IT experience (for instance, experience with AWS Console, Google Console, Azure Services and VMWare ESXi, vCenter).

My main interesting, research and innovations topics are: medical imaging, dicom, ihe, xds, radiation dose, information retrieval, cloud computing and semantic web.
